Balloon Pop! game: 

A simple balloon pop game built using the concepts of Javascript, HTMl, CSS.
This is a two player game.
For simplicity I have used Player One and Player Two as player names and Total Popped will display how many balloons player popped.

->First player one playes the game by clicking on the "start" button.
          Balloons start coming form bottom to top and you click on each balloon to pop them.
Each player has got 10 seconds to pop maximum number of balloons and then it will be players two's turn. 
-> After player ones turn player two will click on "Start" and he will play for 10 secs. 
->Once 10 seconds is done it will display who won the game and it will ask for what do you want to do next.
->Players has option to 'Re-Start' the game or to 'Cancel' the game.

Have fun playing my Balloon Pop Game.
